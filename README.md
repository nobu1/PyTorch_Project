# PyTorch_Project  
This project demonstrates PyTorch implementation using Google Colab.  


## Features of PyTorch Compared to Keras  
### Pros
- Feature-rich and highly expandable  
- Easy to develop custom features as needed  

### Cons  
- The methods for defining machine learning models are somewhat complex  
- We need to write the training process for the machine learning model yourself  

## Execution environment  
- Google Colab
